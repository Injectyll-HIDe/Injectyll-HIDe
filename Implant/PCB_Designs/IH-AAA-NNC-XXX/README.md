# IH-AAA-NNC-XXX-\<Revison\>
These files are the EASYEDA files for the electrical schematic and the PCB layout for our initial release.  
This board uses external crystals.
This board is not easily compatible with an enclosure.  
USB1 is the input from the keyboard.\*  
USB2 is the output from the implant to target.\*

\*\*\***NOTE:**\*\*\*
- The original board that was given away in Las Vegas (marked REV 2.30 on the back) had some incorrect labeling
- USB1 and USB2 are switched. On this board USB2 handles the keyboard input and USB1 sends out the keystrokes
- P1 and P8 on the back of the board are next to the radio connector instead of the SWD pins located right below it
- These labeling issues will be corrected in future releases
